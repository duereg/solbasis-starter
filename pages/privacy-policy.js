We use cookies to ascertain which web pages are visited and how often, to make our Site more user friendly, and to give you a better experience when you return to the Site. For example, cookies allow us to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it every time you visit our Site. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them.

The Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt-out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit www.networkadvertising.org to learn more. In any event, if you reject our cookies, you may still use the Site, but you may be limited in some of the features. We may also work with service providers that use cookies and web beacons to collect information, and to serve advertisements to you across the Internet based on that information.
              Google Analytics. To help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies to report on user interactions on our and others' websites. We use the data collected for optimizing marketing, refining advertising and/or programming strategies, and generally improving user experience.

              Facebook Analytics. We also use Facebook Analytics to measure your use of our Site, tailor our Site to your interests, and improve our products and services. Please note, Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy which can be found at Facebook.com/about/privacy/. Please click here if you would like to withdraw your consent.</p>
              <p><b>SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES</b></p>
              <p>We do not transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include our own service providers such as website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.
              We may share or transfer your personally identifiable information in the course of any direct or indirect reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, bankruptcies, and sales of all or a part of our assets. Your personally identifiable information may be shared following completion of such transaction and/or during the assessment process pending transfer. If transferred in such a case, your information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy or a policy that, at a minimum, protects your privacy to an equal degree as this Privacy Policy. </p>
              <p><b>THIRD PARTY LINKS</b></p>
              <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Site or provide links to other third party websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. To better protect your privacy, we recommend that you review the privacy policy of any third party website you visit. </p>
              <p><b>FORUMS, CHAT ROOMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS</b></p>
              <p>Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to others. If you don't want people to know your email address, for example, don't include it in any message that will be posted publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.</p>
              <p><b>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</b></p>
              <p>If you are visiting our Site from a location outside of the U.S., your connection may be through and to servers located in the U.S. Any information you provide during your visit will be processed and maintained on our server and other internal systems located within the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection laws as the country you are visiting from and may not afford many of the rights conferred upon data subjects in your country. You acknowledge you understand that by providing your personally identifiable information to us, your personally identifiable information (i) will be used for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) may be transferred to the U.S. as indicated above, in accordance with applicable law.</p>
              <p><b>DATA RETENTION</b></p>
              <p>We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide our services and to comply with our accounting and legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
              <p><b>HOW DOES OUR SITE HANDLE DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS?</b></p>
              <p>The “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.</p>
              <p><b>CHILDREN</b></p>
              <p>The Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from visitors under the age of 13 and, in the event that we learn that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such personally identifiable information.
